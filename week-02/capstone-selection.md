# Capstone Selection

## Phase 1: Ideas
- We use [Socrative](https://www.socrative.com/) for this process
    - Instructors will create a question and distribute the link to participants
    - Participants will follow the link and type 1 to 2 sentence ideas in the form
- Instructors will go down the list and lead brief discussion to clarify ideas
- Instructors will eliminate non-appropriate ideas
    - too ambitious: not enough time to code in 7 weeks
    - content irrelevant: more appropriate for another platform
- What Makes a Good Idea
    - fun: you're going to spend 60 hours a week on this
    - semi-original: take an idea and put your own personality into it
    - shareable: something you can explain to mom with a smile

### Datasets
- If possible, find an API that has data you can use
    - Much fuller look come presentation time
- Submit a link to your API with idea
- We're open-minded on datasets subject to the following requirements
    - Good documentation on how to use it
    - Free tier must not have throttling such that it can't feasibly be used
    - Prefer JSON. XML or CSV will be considered only as a last resort
- We've used and loved the following datasets
    - Yelp
    - GitHub
    - Slack
    - ABQ Open Data https://www.cabq.gov/abq-data
    - Twitter
    - Reddit
- These datasets have not been verified

## Phase 2: Informal vote by show of hands
- Instructors will go down the list and get a show of hands to see who is interested
- Each participant may vote for up to 5 projects
- How many projects?
    - Capstone groups will be 3-4 students
    - If the number of projects will be N, this phase will reduce the projects to N+1

## Phase 3: Secret voting
- Each participant writes down and orders their choices from 1 to N
    - Example:
        ```
        1. Public Art Map
        2. Political Organizing App
        3. Music Calendar
        4. Plant Selector
        ```

## Phase 4: Instructors select teams
- We balance several factors when putting together teams
    - strength of team
    - desire for project
    - interpersonal fit

## Phase 5: Announcement
- Teams will be announced beginning of week 3
