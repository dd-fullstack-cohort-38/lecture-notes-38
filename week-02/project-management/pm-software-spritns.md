# PM Software and Sprints
## Our project management system
- Slack channel per capstone group
    - These are for you guys - use them!
    - Pick a team name and tell us. We'll change the channel name accordingly
- [Asana](https://asana.com/) - our project management software
    - We will be sending you invites, make sure you create your login and join the project
- Two-week sprints, each focused around a different topic
- Stand-up meetings will now start having more capstone info
    - Make sure you are listening to your capstone team members

### Planning Sprints
- Each team is responsible for creating, grooming, and claiming their tickets for every upcoming sprint
    - We have put sample tickets into the project for you, and you will need to alter and/or clone tickets for them
        - Anytime you see 'Foo', you will need to change that to a value that makes sense for your project
    - Your team can add tickets whenever you think it is necessary.
    - **grooming** - Looking over your group's upcoming tickets, making sure that they all have SMART User Stories in them
        - Specific - clearly defined goals
        - Measurable - you can tell when it's done
        - Achievable - not impossible
        - Relevant - actually get you closer to the end goal of a presentable capstone
        - Time-based - can be finished within the two-week sprint
    - **claiming** - Assigning a ticket to yourself, saying that you will do it.
    - One ticket in each sprint is simply to set up the upcoming sprint with new tickets. That is the
      single most important ticket, so make sure you have it ready at the end of your previous sprint

### During Sprints
- When you begin working on a ticket, change the status to **In Progress**
    - Each developer should only have one In Progress ticket at a time, and should work on that ticket until it is **Ready for Testing**.
- If you are unable to complete work on a ticket because it is waiting on something else, change the status to **Blocked**
- Every Friday morning is **Ticket Burn Down Day**
    - Tickets are only allowed to be marked **Complete** by explicit OK from the project stakeholders (Instructors)
    - Goal for first week Ticket Burn Down Day is to have half about half your tickets Ready for testing, and a few additional In Progress
    - Goal for second Ticket Burn Down Day is to have all tickets complete
        - This includes the ticket to have your tickets created for next sprint!
    - Testing consists of
        - Reviewing the user story
        - Showing the Instructor how your code addresses the user story
        - If the instructor agrees, they mark the ticket complete
    - If you have a 3+ tickets ready for testing, you should request an additional ticket burn down mid-week.
